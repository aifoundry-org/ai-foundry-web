                We desire to see the industry aligned on the principles of how those systems are structured at<br/>a high level from which every company can<br/>deploy its own engine or system, configured the<br/>way each specific company needs it. This approach will lower risks and improve AI results for all companies and practitioners. Therefore, we foster, build, and support projects that can<br/>become the engineering foundation of such training and deployment systems. We support practitioners willing to benefit from AI in their work and life, specifically models and their fine-tuning and deployment.
                <br/><br/>
                We are a community of practitioners building an open-source composable AI ecosystem. By collaborating on standards for everyone, we aim to reduce the complexity of the AI industry.
